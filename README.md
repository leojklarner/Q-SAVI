**Abstract**: Accelerating the discovery of novel and more effective therapeutics is an important pharmaceutical problem in which deep learning is playing an increasingly significant role. However, real-world drug discovery tasks are often characterized by a scarcity of labeled data and significant covariate shiftâ€”a setting that poses a challenge to standard deep learning methods.

In this paper, we present Q-SAVI, a probabilistic model able to address these challenges by encoding explicit prior knowledge of the data-generating process into a prior distribution over functions, presenting researchers with a transparent and probabilistically principled way to encode data-driven modeling preferences. Building on a novel, gold-standard bioactivity dataset that facilitates a meaningful comparison of models in an extrapolative regime, we explore different approaches to induce data shift and construct a challenging evaluation setup. We then demonstrate that using Q-SAVI to integrate contextualized prior knowledge of drug-like chemical space into the modeling process affords substantial gains in predictive accuracy and calibration, outperforming a broad range of state-of-the-art self-supervised pre-training and domain adaptation techniques.

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/` contains the both the raw and processed data, as well as all processing utilities required to derive the anti-maralarial dataset and the ZINC-based context point distribution.
  - `datasets/` contains the raw and processed anti-malarial dataset, as well as ~2m unlabeled molecular structures from the ZINC database.
  - `preprocess_antimalarial_data.ipynb` annotated notebook that describes all procedures used for data curation, covariate and label shift quantification, and data splitting.
  - `preprocess_zinc.py` utilities to convert ZINC SMILES strings to ECFPs and rdkitFPs.
- `qsavi/` contains all models, objectives and utilities required to reproduce and extend the results presented in the paper.
  - `bayesian_mlps.py` definition of stochastic MLPs used in the paper.
  - `config.py` default hyperparameter settings and search spaces.
  - `context_points.py` functions to sample from pre-processed context point distribution.
  - `data_loader.py` data loading and processing utilities.
  - `linearization.py` linearization utilities for the objective evaluation.
  - `objective.py` implementation of the function-space objective presented in the paper.
  - `qsavi.py` Q-SAVI class that combines stochastic MLPs with function-space objective.
  - `utils.py` miscellaneous utilities.
